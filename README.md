# A Simple Android Application

![on device](docs/on_device.jpg)

This project acts as a personal template for developing cross-platform
applications that work simultaneously in Windows/OSx/Linux desktop 
environments, as well as mobile operating systems.

The project focuses on generating Android .apks, however simply running 
```main.py``` is enough to launch it on the desktop.
